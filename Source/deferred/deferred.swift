/// An asynchronous computation.

/// A `Deferred` starts out unresolved, in the `.waiting` state.
/// It may then enter the `.executing` state, and may eventually become resolved,
/// either having `.succeeded` or `.errored`.
///
/// A `Deferred` that becomes resolved, will henceforth always be resolved: it can no longer mutate.
///
/// The `get()` function will return the value of the computation's `Result` (or throw a `Failure`),
/// blocking until it becomes available. If the result of the computation is known when `get()` is called,
/// it will return immediately.
/// The properties `value` and `error` are convenient non-throwing (but blocking) wrappers  for the `get()` method.
///
/// Closures supplied to the `enqueue` function will be called after the `Deferred` has become resolved.
/// The functions `map`, `flatMap`, `notify` and others are wrappers that add functionality to the `enqueue` function.
